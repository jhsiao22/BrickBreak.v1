# BrickBreak.v1
This was my Final Project for Intro to Computer Programming sophomore year of high school.

I created a twist on the classic BrickBreak game sophomore year of high school. I changed it by changing up the rules of the game. In order for the bricks to "break" the ball needs to be the same color as the brick. To change the color of the ball, use 1, 2, 3, or 4. It will change the color of the ball to red, yellow, green, and blue respectively. There are three levels to this game. If you die partway through the game, you can reset that level and try again. Additionally, I made all of the graphics for this game by myself using Corel Painter Essentials 4 and a small Wacom tablet.
